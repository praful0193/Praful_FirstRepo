1st month experience at IITP

Honestly I came with a huge expectation consideringth the tag of IIT and all the stuff. But my expectations fell after seeing the hostels and other things, more than that the unorganised process of registration in that scorching sun, with no one to guide us was like a hell. I started thinking is this an IIT. But after a couple of days I got adjusted to the hostel and lickily I didn't face any issues with the food it was ok to me unlike others. But suddenly I realised another problem which was the network issue, inspite of having 2GB data per day, it was usless as I was not getting network connection in my room and this problem was limited to my room many places of this IIT Patna. Yeah these were my initial impressions which were not that great but now I have got used to it. 

So coming to college I wanted to explore, so I jonied Yavnika the dramatics club of iit patna and got a chance to participate in mime in nebula which was awesome. But was unable to enjoy other performances, but it's ok . The DJ night compensated it
